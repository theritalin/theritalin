### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is theritalin (also known as thertln and Reeta). I am a teacher. But I am interested in programming for the past 4 years. I've learned flutter for mobile and web applications and now I am interested in web3. So I involve in blockchain projects with testnets. I setup nodes on testnets and mainnets. I use javascript, python for automations and flutter for mobile, soldity for contracts. Also I have started to learn rust.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is theritalin (also known as thertln and Reeta). I am a teacher. But I am interested in programming for the past 4 years. I've learned flutter for mobile and web applications and now I am interested in web3. So I involve in blockchain projects with testnets. I setup nodes on testnets and mainnets.
